  - Returns a rejected promise with a 404 error for other URLs.
- Mocks the `axios.post` method as a Jest function.

**Dependencies:**  
- Jest mocking utilities.

**Connections:**  
- Used in tests requiring HTTP request simulation without making actual network calls.

**Current Status:**  
Completed.

**Issues/Challenges:**  
None identified.

**Next Steps:**  
- Add additional mocked HTTP methods if needed for future tests.
