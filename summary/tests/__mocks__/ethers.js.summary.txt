**Project Path:** `__mocks__/ethers.js`

**File Purpose:**  
Provides a mock implementation of the `ethers` library, focusing on common contract interactions and utility functions.

**Key Functionality:**  
- Mocks:
  - `Contract` class with methods like `mint`, `balanceOf`, and `transferFrom`.
  - `Wallet` and `JsonRpcProvider` classes for testing blockchain-related interactions.
- Simplistic mock implementations of utility functions `parseUnits` and `formatUnits`.
- Maintains alignment with `ethers` v6 API.

**Dependencies:**  
- Jest mocking utilities.
- Partial reliance on the actual `ethers` library via `jest.requireActual`.

**Connections:**  
- Used in tests involving smart contract interactions, wallet operations, and other Ethereum blockchain features.

**Current Status:**  
Completed.

**Issues/Challenges:**  
None identified.

**Next Steps:**  
- Expand mock methods and utilities as needed for additional blockchain use cases.
