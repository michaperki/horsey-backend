### **`backend/tests/setupTests.js`**

**Purpose:**  
Sets up global test configurations, including environment variables, database initialization, and Jest configurations.

**Key Functionality:**  
- Loads `.env.test` for test-specific environment variables.
- Mocks `console.error` globally to suppress unwanted logs.
- Ensures database is cleared after each test and closed after all tests.

**Dependencies:**  
- Jest
- `dotenv`
- `setup.js`

**Connections:**  
- Configures the test environment for all backend tests.

**Current Status:**  
Completed.

**Next Steps:**  
- Expand Jest configurations as needed for additional test optimizations.
