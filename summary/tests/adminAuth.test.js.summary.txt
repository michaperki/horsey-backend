**File Location:** backend/tests/adminAuth.test.js

**File Purpose:**  
Tests the admin authentication routes, including admin registration and login functionalities, ensuring secure and correct behavior.

**Key Functionality:**
- Tests successful admin login and token issuance.
- Validates error handling for incorrect credentials, missing fields, and duplicate registrations.
- Ensures that only authenticated admins can register new admin accounts.
- Mocks database operations and JWT token generation for isolated testing.

**Dependencies:**
- `supertest`
- `mongoose`
- `User` model
- `bcrypt`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `jest`

**Connections:**
- Interacts with the Express application server (`../server`).
- Communicates with the `User` model to create and authenticate admin accounts.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Comprehensive test cases for admin authentication are implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Mocking and restoring functions correctly to prevent test interference.
- Ensuring test isolation to maintain reliability and repeatability.

**Next Steps:**
- Add tests for token expiration and refresh scenarios.
- Implement integration tests to cover end-to-end admin authentication flows.
