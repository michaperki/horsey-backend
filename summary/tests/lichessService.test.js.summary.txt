### **File Location:** `backend/tests/lichessService.test.js`

**File Purpose:**  
Tests the `lichessService` functions, ensuring reliable interaction with the Lichess API and correct handling of both real and mocked data.

**Key Functionality:**
- Mocks `axios` for API interactions to simulate different Lichess API responses.
- Tests `getGameOutcome` for successful outcome retrieval, handling API errors, and processing invalid game data.
- Tests `createLichessGame` for successful game creation via a Lichess bot account and handling creation failures.
- Validates proper error logging via `console.error` to ensure issues are traceable.

**Dependencies:**
- `jest`
- `axios` (mocked)
- `lichessService` module

**Connections:**
- Validates the functionality and resilience of `lichessService`.
- Ensures that controllers depending on `lichessService` receive accurate and reliable data.

**Current Status:**
- **Completed:** Tests cover successful and failure scenarios for both game outcome retrieval and game creation.
- **Refined:** Consolidated function definitions ensure accurate testing without redundancy.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring that mocked responses accurately represent possible real-world Lichess API responses.
- Handling asynchronous behavior in tests to prevent false positives or negatives.
- Maintaining up-to-date mocks as the Lichess API evolves or as application requirements change.

**Next Steps:**
- Add more edge cases, such as timeout scenarios or unexpected API structures.
- Implement tests for rate limiting and retry logic within `lichessService`.
- Explore using tools like [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) for more advanced HTTP mocking if needed.
- Ensure that any new features or changes in `lichessService` are promptly reflected in the tests.
