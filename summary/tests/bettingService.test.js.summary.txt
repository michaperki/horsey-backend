**File Location:** backend/tests/bettingService.test.js

**File Purpose:**  
Tests the betting service, particularly the processing of bet outcomes based on game results, ensuring correct logic and error handling.

**Key Functionality:**
- Tests successful processing of winning bets, including token minting and status updates.
- Validates handling of losing bets and ensures correct status assignments.
- Tests error handling for invalid game outcomes and service failures.
- Mocks `tokenService` and `lichessService` to isolate service logic.

**Dependencies:**
- `mongoose`
- `User` model
- `Bet` model
- `tokenService`
- `lichessService`
- `jest`

**Connections:**
- Interacts with the `Bet` and `User` models to update bet statuses and manage user balances.
- Utilizes mocked services to handle token minting and game outcome fetching.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Comprehensive test cases for betting service are implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring mocked services accurately simulate real-world responses.
- Managing state consistency across multiple bet processing scenarios.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement tests for transactional integrity and rollback mechanisms.
- Enhance service logic to handle more complex betting scenarios.
