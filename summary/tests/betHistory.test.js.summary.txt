**File Location:** backend/tests/betHistory.test.js

**File Purpose:**  
Tests the retrieval of a user's bet history, ensuring correct pagination, sorting, and data integrity.

**Key Functionality:**
- Tests default pagination and sorting of bet history.
- Validates custom page and limit parameters.
- Ensures sorting by different fields like `amount`.
- Checks error responses for invalid sort fields and unauthenticated access.
- Mocks database interactions to isolate test scenarios.

**Dependencies:**
- `supertest`
- `mongoose`
- `User` model
- `Bet` model
- `bcrypt`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `jest`

**Connections:**
- Interacts with the Express application server (`../server`).
- Communicates with `User` and `Bet` models to fetch and verify bet data.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Comprehensive test cases for bet history retrieval are implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Managing test data setup and teardown to ensure consistent test environments.
- Handling large datasets efficiently within tests.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement tests for additional filters like bet status or date ranges.
- Optimize test performance for larger bet histories.
