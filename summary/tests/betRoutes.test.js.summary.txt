**File Location:** backend/tests/betRoutes.test.js

**File Purpose:**  
Tests the betting routes, including placing bets and accepting bets, ensuring correct functionality and error handling.

**Key Functionality:**
- Tests successful bet placement and updates to user balances.
- Validates error responses for insufficient balances and server errors.
- Tests accepting bets, including color assignment and balance deductions.
- Mocks external services like `lichessService` and `emailService` to isolate test cases.
- Ensures proper handling of edge cases and error scenarios.

**Dependencies:**
- `supertest`
- `mongoose`
- `User` model
- `Bet` model
- `bcrypt`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `jest`

**Connections:**
- Interacts with the Express application server (`../server`).
- Communicates with `User` and `Bet` models to manage bet data and user balances.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Comprehensive test cases for betting routes are implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring accurate mocking of external services to reflect realistic scenarios.
- Managing test data to cover various bet states and user roles.

**Next Steps:**
- Add tests for additional betting features like bet cancellation.
- Implement integration tests to cover end-to-end betting workflows.
