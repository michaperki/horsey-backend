### **`backend/tests/tokenService.test.js`**

**Purpose:**  
Tests the `tokenService` for minting tokens and other Ethereum-based functionalities.

**Key Functionality:**  
- **Mint Tokens**:
  - Validates successful token minting with mocked Ethereum contract interactions.
  - Tests failure scenarios during token minting.
- Mocks:
  - Ethereum contract methods (`mint`, `balanceOf`, `transferFrom`).
  - Utility functions like `parseUnits` and `formatUnits`.

**Dependencies:**  
- Jest for testing and mocking
- Mocked `ethers` library
- `tokenService`

**Connections:**  
- Ensures `tokenService` interacts correctly with Ethereum contracts and handles errors gracefully.

**Current Status:**  
Completed.

**Next Steps:**  
- Add tests for `getBalance` and `transferTokens` methods.
