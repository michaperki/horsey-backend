**File Location:** backend/models/User.js

**File Purpose:**  
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for managing user accounts within the application.

**Key Functionality:**
- Schema fields include `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `balance`, and `notificationPreferences`.
- Enforces unique constraints on `username` and `email`.
- Sets default values for `role` (defaulting to 'user') and `balance`.
- Includes sub-documents for notification preferences.

**Dependencies:**
- `mongoose`

**Connections:**
- Referenced by `Bet` model through `creatorId` and `opponentId`.
- Utilized by authentication routes and services for user management and authentication.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Mongoose model for users is fully defined and operational.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Securing user passwords and handling password resets securely.
- Managing user roles and permissions effectively as the application scales.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement password reset and account recovery mechanisms.
- Enhance profile management features, such as updating notification preferences.
