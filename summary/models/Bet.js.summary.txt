### **File Location:** `backend/models/Bet.js`

**File Purpose:**  
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for managing bets within the application.

**Key Functionality:**
- Schema fields include `creatorId`, `opponentId`, `creatorColor`, `opponentColor`, `finalWhiteId`, `finalBlackId`, `gameId`, `amount`, `status`, and `timeControl`.
- Implements timestamps and indexes for efficient querying and sorting.
- Sets default values and enumerations for specific fields to enforce data integrity.
- Provides compound indexes on `creatorId` and `opponentId` combined with `createdAt` for optimized query performance.

**Dependencies:**
- `mongoose`

**Connections:**
- References the `User` model through `creatorId` and `opponentId`.
- Utilized by controllers and services to create, read, update, and delete bet records.

**Current Status:**
- **Completed:** Mongoose model for bets is fully defined and operational.
- **Optimized:** Indexes are set up to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity across related fields.
- Optimizing indexes for high-performance queries in large datasets.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement virtual fields or methods for additional bet-related computations.
- Add pre-save hooks for automated data validations or transformations.
- Explore using Mongoose plugins for enhanced functionality (e.g., pagination).
