**File Location:** backend/models/Bet.js

**File Purpose:**  
Defines the Mongoose schema and model for managing bets within the application.

**Key Functionality:**
- Schema fields include `creatorId`, `opponentId`, `creatorColor`, `opponentColor`, `gameId`, `amount`, and `status`.
- Implements timestamps and indexes for efficient querying and sorting.
- Sets default values and enumerations for specific fields to enforce data integrity.

**Dependencies:**
- `mongoose`

**Connections:**
- Interacts with `User` model through references (`creatorId` and `opponentId`).
- Utilized by controllers and services to create, read, update, and delete bet records.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Mongoose model for bets is fully defined and operational.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity across related fields.
- Optimizing indexes for high-performance queries in large datasets.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement virtual fields or methods for additional bet-related computations.
- Add pre-save hooks for automated data validations or transformations.
