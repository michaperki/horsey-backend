### **File Name:** db.js

**File Location:** backend/config/db.js

**File Purpose:**  
Establishes and manages the connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

**Key Functionality:**
- Loads environment variables using `dotenv`.
- Determines the MongoDB URI based on the `NODE_ENV` (test or production).
- Attempts to connect to MongoDB and logs the connection status.
- Handles connection errors by logging and exiting the process.

**Dependencies:**
- `mongoose`
- `dotenv`

**Connections:**
- Called by `index.js` to initiate the database connection before starting the server.
- Utilizes environment variables for configuration.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Reliable database connection setup is implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Requires proper environment variable configuration to avoid connection issues.
- Handles process termination on connection failure, which might need graceful shutdown mechanisms.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement retry logic for transient connection failures.
- Enhance logging for better monitoring and debugging.
