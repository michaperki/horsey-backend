**File Location:** backend/jest.config.js

**File Purpose:**  
Configures Jest for testing the backend application, specifying test environment, coverage settings, and module path ignores.

**Key Functionality:**
- Sets the test environment to `node`.
- Defines setup files to run after the environment is set up.
- Ignores specific module paths during testing.
- Configures coverage collection from specified directories and sets coverage reporters.

**Dependencies:**
- `jest`
- `mongodb-memory-server` for in-memory MongoDB during tests

**Connections:**
- Applied across all test files to ensure consistent testing configurations.
- Integrates with test setup files to initialize and clean up the testing environment.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Jest is configured for effective testing with coverage reports.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring coverage settings accurately reflect the codebase for meaningful reports.
- Managing test performance, especially with extensive coverage reporting.

**Next Steps:**
- Refine coverage thresholds to enforce code quality.
- Optimize test suites for faster execution times.
