**File Purpose:**  
Manages bet-related operations, including retrieving bet history and available game seekers.

**Key Functionality:**

- `getAvailableSeekers`: Fetches all pending bets (game seekers) available for matching.

**Dependencies:**
- `Bet` model
- `User` model
- Authentication middleware
- `lichessService` for game outcome verification

**Connections:**
- Interacts with `Bet` and `User` models to fetch and manipulate bet data.
- Utilizes authentication middleware to ensure secure access.
- Connects with `lichessService` to verify game statuses.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Core functionalities for managing bets are implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring efficient database queries for large datasets.
- Handling edge cases such as missing or inconsistent data.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement additional filters for bet retrieval (e.g., by status, date range).
- Optimize database indexes for faster query performance.
