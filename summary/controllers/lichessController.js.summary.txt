**File Location:** backend/controllers/lichessController.js

**File Purpose:**  
Handles the validation of game results from Lichess and updates related bets accordingly.

**Key Functionality:**
- `validateResultHandler`: Validates game outcomes, updates bet statuses to 'won' or 'lost', mints tokens for winners, and sends notification emails.
- Error handling for fetching game outcomes and token minting failures.

**Dependencies:**
- `lichessService` for fetching game outcomes
- `Bet` model
- `User` model
- `tokenService` for minting tokens
- `emailService` for sending notifications

**Connections:**
- Receives requests from admin-authenticated routes to validate game results.
- Interacts with multiple services and models to process bet outcomes.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Functional handler for processing game results and updating bets.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Managing race conditions when multiple bets are processed simultaneously.
- Ensuring reliability in token minting and email notifications.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement transactional operations to ensure atomicity.
- Add more robust error recovery mechanisms for failed operations.
