**File Location:** backend/routes/tokenRoutes.js

**File Purpose:**  
Manages routes related to token operations, including minting tokens, retrieving user balances, and fetching token balances by address.

**Key Functionality:**
- `POST /tokens/mint`: Allows admin users to mint tokens to a specified address.
- `GET /tokens/balance/user`: Retrieves the authenticated user's token balance.
- `GET /tokens/balance/:address`: Allows admin users to fetch token balances for any given address.

**Dependencies:**
- `express`
- `tokenService`
- `authMiddleware`
- `User` model
- `Bet` model

**Connections:**
- Secured routes requiring appropriate authentication and authorization.
- Interfaces with `tokenService` to perform blockchain token operations.
- Interacts with `User` and `Bet` models for balance management.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: All token-related routes are implemented and operational.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring secure access to minting operations to prevent unauthorized token creation.
- Handling blockchain transaction failures and ensuring data consistency.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring for token-related routes.
- Enhance error handling to provide more informative responses to clients.
