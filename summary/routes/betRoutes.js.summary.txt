**File Location:** backend/routes/betRoutes.js

**File Purpose:**  
Defines routes related to betting operations, including placing bets, accepting bets, retrieving bet history, and fetching available seekers.

**Key Functionality:**
- `POST /bets/place`: Allows authenticated users to place new bets.
- `POST /bets/accept/:betId`: Enables users to accept existing pending bets.
- `GET /bets/history`: Retrieves the authenticated user's bet history with pagination and sorting.
- `GET /bets/seekers`: Fetches all available game seekers (pending bets).

**Dependencies:**
- `express`
- `Bet` model
- `User` model
- `authMiddleware` for authentication
- `betController` for handling bet-related logic
- `lichessService` for game outcome verification

**Connections:**
- Interacts with `Bet` and `User` models to manage bet data.
- Utilizes authentication middleware to secure routes.
- Connects with `lichessService` to verify game statuses before allowing bets.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: All primary betting routes are implemented and functional.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring data consistency when multiple users place or accept bets simultaneously.
- Handling edge cases such as invalid game IDs or insufficient user balances.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement additional features like bet cancellation or modification.
- Enhance validation and error handling for more robust operations.
