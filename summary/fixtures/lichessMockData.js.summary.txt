**File Location:** backend/fixtures/lichessMockData.js

**File Purpose:**  
Provides mocked data for Lichess game outcomes to facilitate testing without relying on external API calls.

**Key Functionality:**
- Defines a `mockedGameOutcome` object representing a successful game result.
- Exports the mocked data for use in tests.

**Dependencies:**
- None directly, but used by `lichessService` and test files.

**Connections:**
- Utilized by `lichessService` when `MOCK_LICHESS` environment variable is enabled.
- Employed in test cases to simulate game outcomes.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Mock data is available for testing purposes.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring mocked data covers all necessary test scenarios.
- Maintaining synchronization with real API responses for consistency.

**Next Steps:**
- Expand mocked data to include various game outcomes and statuses.
- Implement dynamic mocking based on different test requirements.
