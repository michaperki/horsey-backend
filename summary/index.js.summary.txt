**File Location:** backend/index.js

**File Purpose:**  
Entry point for the backend application, responsible for initializing environment variables, connecting to the database, and starting the server.

**Key Functionality:**
- Loads environment variables using `dotenv`.
- Logs critical environment variables for verification.
- Connects to MongoDB using `connectDB` unless in a test environment.
- Starts the Express server on the specified port after a successful database connection.

**Dependencies:**
- `express`
- `dotenv`
- `connectDB` from `config/db.js`

**Connections:**
- Interfaces with the Express application (`server.js`) to start the server.
- Utilizes environment variables for configuration.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Successfully initializes and starts the backend server.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring environment variables are correctly set and secured.
- Handling connection failures gracefully to prevent server crashes.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement health check endpoints for monitoring.
- Enhance logging for better observability in production environments.
