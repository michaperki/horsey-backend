**File Location:** backend/services/bettingService.js

**File Purpose:**  
Provides services for processing bet outcomes based on game results, including determining winners, minting tokens, and updating bet statuses.

**Key Functionality:**
- `processBetOutcome`: Fetches game outcomes, identifies winning and losing bets, mints tokens for winners, and updates bet statuses accordingly.
- Handles errors related to game outcome fetching and token minting.

**Dependencies:**
- `tokenService`
- `lichessService`
- `Bet` model
- `User` model

**Connections:**
- Interacts with `tokenService` to handle token minting operations.
- Utilizes `lichessService` to retrieve game outcomes from Lichess.
- Communicates with `Bet` and `User` models to update and manage bet data.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Betting outcome processing is implemented and operational.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring atomicity and consistency when processing multiple bets simultaneously.
- Handling failures in token minting without leaving bets in inconsistent states.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement transactional operations to ensure all-or-nothing processing of bet outcomes.
- Enhance logging and monitoring for better traceability and debugging.
