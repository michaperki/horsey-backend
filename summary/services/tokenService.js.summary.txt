**File Location:** backend/services/tokenService.js

**File Purpose:**  
Facilitates interactions with the `PromoToken` smart contract on the blockchain, including minting, transferring, and querying token balances.

**Key Functionality:**
- `mintTokens`: Mints a specified amount of tokens to a given address.
- `getBalance`: Retrieves the token balance of a specified address.
- `transferTokens`: Transfers tokens from one address to another.

**Dependencies:**
- `ethers`
- `dotenv`
- `PromoToken.json` ABI

**Connections:**
- Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via `ethers` and the `PromoToken` smart contract.
- Utilized by routes and services to manage token operations for users and bets.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Token operations are implemented and functional.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Managing private keys and ensuring secure interactions with the blockchain.
- Handling blockchain transaction failures and ensuring data consistency.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement additional token functionalities as required.
- Enhance security measures for key management and transaction handling.
