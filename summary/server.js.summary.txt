**File Location:** backend/server.js

**File Purpose:**  
Sets up the Express application, configures middleware, and defines all API routes for the backend.

**Key Functionality:**
- Configures CORS with allowed origins and credentials support.
- Parses incoming JSON requests.
- Defines and mounts various route handlers for authentication, payments, Lichess integrations, tokens, bets, and email testing.
- Includes a placeholder route for basic server verification.
- Implements a CORS error handler middleware.

**Dependencies:**
- `express`
- `cors`
- Route modules (`adminAuth`, `userAuth`, `payments`, `lichess`, `tokenRoutes`, `betRoutes`, `testEmail`)

**Connections:**
- Serves as the central hub connecting all route handlers and middleware.
- Interfaces with authentication middleware to secure routes.
- Utilizes environment variables for configuration and CORS settings.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Express application is fully configured with all necessary routes and middleware.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Managing CORS configurations to balance security and accessibility.
- Ensuring scalability and maintainability as the application grows.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement additional middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation.
- Optimize route structures and potentially modularize further for better maintainability.
