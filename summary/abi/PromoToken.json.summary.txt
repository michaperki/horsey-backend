j*File Location:** backend/abi/PromoToken.json

**File Purpose:**  
Defines the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode for the `PromoToken` smart contract, facilitating interaction between the backend and the Ethereum blockchain.

**Key Functionality:**
- Specifies constructor inputs, errors, events, and functions of the `PromoToken` smart contract.
- Contains both `abi` and `bytecode` necessary for deploying and interacting with the contract.
- Includes methods for token operations such as `mint`, `transfer`, `approve`, and querying balances.

**Dependencies:**
- None directly, but used by `tokenService.js` for blockchain interactions.

**Connections:**
- Utilized by the backend services to interact with the `PromoToken` smart contract deployed on the blockchain.
- Essential for functions like minting tokens, transferring tokens, and checking balances.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: ABI and bytecode are defined and ready for deployment and integration.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Ensuring the ABI remains synchronized with the deployed smart contract version.
- Managing security aspects related to smart contract interactions.

**Next Steps:**
- Update the ABI and bytecode upon any changes to the smart contract.
- Implement additional contract functions if required by future features.
