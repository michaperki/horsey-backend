**File Location:** backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js

**File Purpose:**  
Provides authentication and authorization middleware for securing backend routes using JWT.

**Key Functionality:**
- `authenticateToken`: Verifies JWT tokens from the `Authorization` header and attaches user information to the request object.
- `authorizeRole`: Checks if the authenticated user has the required role to access certain routes.

**Dependencies:**
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `dotenv`

**Connections:**
- Applied to protected routes to enforce authentication and role-based access control.
- Utilizes environment variables for JWT secret configuration.

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Robust middleware for securing routes is implemented.

**Issues/Challenges:**
- Managing token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
- Securing JWT secrets to prevent unauthorized access.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement token refresh endpoints for extended sessions.
- Enhance error handling for various authentication failures.
